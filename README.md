# Fullstack D3

[_Fullstack D3_](https://www.newline.co/fullstack-d3) is an incredibly informative book from [_Amelia Wattenberger_](https://wattenberger.com/) centered on the D3 library. With this folder I replicate the examples provided in the book, and annotate the lessons learned in the process.

_Please note_:

- I am quite familiar with the D3 library already, and I approach the book with the goal of improving my workflow

- the visualizations are recreated D3 version 6, retrieved from [unpkg.com](https://unpkg.com/d3) on March 4th 2021
